            HistorySeeker.com is an application for assisting in self-directed history learning.  Its primary mechanism consists of building a personal database of facts that have both geographical and temporal associations.  One of the primary interfaces for viewing the facts consists of a map combined with a time range slider.  In this way a user can easily answer questions like “which areas of the world do I have insufficient knowledge of in the 1600s?”
