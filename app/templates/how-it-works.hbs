            HistorySeeker.com is an application for assisting in self-directed history learning.  Its primary mechanism consists of building a personal database of facts that have both geographical and temporal associations. We beleive that by viewing historical events in both their temporal and geographical context students can move beyond just <em>learning</em> history and they can begin to <em>understand</em> history.</p>
          <p class='intro-text'>
            One of the primary interfaces for viewing the facts consists of a map combined with a time range slider.  In this way a user can easily answer questions like “which areas of the world do I have insufficient knowledge of in the 1600s?”
          </p>

            To supplement the freeform structure of the application, once a week we will have a new history lesson that will cover in depth one topic. The lesson will be developed by a qualified history instructor. The topic of the lessons each week will be drawn from questions and suggestions offered by our students and the lesson will be archived and viewable at any time after it is posted. Further, the instructor will take time during the lesson to answer specific questions that students and teachers have submitted over the course the preceding few weeks.
