          We believe that there is a dearth of well designed tools built specifically for home educators. History Seeker aims to provide you with the infrastructure to develop a high quality, extensible history education. We do this by giving you the tools you need to construct a curriculum that fits your needs.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          History Seeker was built by people with a passion for software, history, and homeschool. We intend to use History Seeker in our own homes, with our own children.
