        We believe that there is a massive gap in well designed tools built specifically for home educators. historySeeker aims to provide you with the infrastructure to develop a high quality, extensible history education. We do this by giving you the tools you need to construct a curriculum that fits your situation.

          HistorySeeker was built by software developers, historians, and parents. We use historySeeker in our own homes, with our own children. We care about the education of our children, and that shows in the product that we deliver.
